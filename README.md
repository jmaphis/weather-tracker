## About

Weather Tracker is a minimalistic weather app by James Maphis, powered by the [Visual Crossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/) weather API. 

Currently only set up to work with area codes in the US.

To use the app, simply visit [https://maphis-weather.netlify.app/](https://maphis-weather.netlify.app/), and enter the zip code you would like to get the weather for. Initially, Weather Tracker will detect your browser's dark mode settings, but you can manually change between dark and light mode using the chack box in the upper right hand corner.

To work with the code, simply clone the repository, then navigate to the containing folder, and run the following:

```
> npm install
> npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
